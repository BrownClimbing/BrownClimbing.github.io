Yes! Lincoln Woods is a fantastic outdoor bouldering spot about 20 minutes from campus. More information can be found on [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105913161/lincoln-woods).

For those who like sport climbing and donâ€™t mind a drive, Rumney is about a 3 hour drive from campus. The Gunks, located in New Paltz, NY are the premier trad climbing location in the North East. More information can be found on the gunks app.

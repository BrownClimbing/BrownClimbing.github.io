question: What are the climbing gyms near Brown?
---

There are two gyms near Brown’s campus. [Rock Spot](https://providence.rockspotclimbing.com/) is a bouldering-only gym that’s a 5-10 minute drive from campus and about 20 minutes away by RIPTA (public bus system) or biking.[Central Rock Gym](https://centralrockgym.com/warwick/) in Warwick is about 15-20 minutes away by car but can’t easily be accessed by public transportation. CRG has both bouldering, top rope and sport climbing.

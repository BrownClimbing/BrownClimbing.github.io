question: How much does it cost to go to the gym?
---

If you don't want to use RIPTA to get to the gym (which is free if you use your Brown ID), ubers usually cost ~$10.

If you are under 24, Rock Spot costs $20 for a day pass ($26 to include gear). 10-punch passes are $199 or $249 with gear included. Monthly memberships are around $70/month (if you are under 24), but also have an activation fee of around $20. [Rock Spot](https://providence.rockspotclimbing.com/) almost always has monthly deals, so check their website or call!

CRG costs $20 for a day pass (for people under 22) and rental gear is another $8 for harness, shoes, and chalk. 5-punch passes are available; call to ask for their price. Discounted memberships (again 22 and under) are $75/month and don't have a start-up fee. More information [here](https://centralrockgym.com/warwick/pricing/day-use/).

Note that if you come to one of our events [TODO include link], we usually help cover expenses!

question: How do I get to Rock Spot with public transportation?
---

There are a few RIPTA buses that can get you to Rock Spot from Brown’s campus. Most go through Kennedy Plaza, where you’ll have to get off and take another bus.

- The 1, 32, 33, and 34 all go to Kennedy Plaza. Get on at Tunnel and Thayer or a stop before (check Google Maps or Transit for more info). Alternatively, sometimes it's just faster to walk to Kennedy Plaza.
- From Kennedy Plaza, take the R, 20, or 22 line to Lockwood Street (which is a short walk to the gym).
- Going back to Brown is the same process but in reverse.

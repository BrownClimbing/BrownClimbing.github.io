SNC is our weekly event where we go to Rock Spot Providence, a local bouldering gym. We meet at Faunce Arch every Sunday at 6pm so that we can coordinate transportation. If it's your first time climbing with us, then you get a FREE day pass (gear included) - otherwise, day passes are available at a discounted cost of $14.50.

To sign up, fill out the form that was sent in our most recent weekly email. If you need to be added to our mailing list, you can join [here]() [TODO: provide link].
Note: due to liability reasons, we have to check that you have actually filled out this form before you get any discounts.
